styling: "css_modules"
testing: "jest"

## File Structure Rules

structure:

- "Keep original extension structure from LinkedIn repo"
- "Remove ALL LinkedIn business logic"
- "Maintain TypeScript configuration"
- "Keep build pipeline intact"
- "Use pnpm for all package management"

## Code Standards

coding_rules:

- "Use TypeScript strict mode"
- "Follow browser extension best practices"
- "Match GitHub's CSS variable naming"
- "Implement proper error boundaries"
- "Use async/await for storage operations"
- "Follow manifest v3 patterns"

## GitHub Integration Rules

github_rules:

- "Target ONLY github.com domain"
- "Use GitHub's existing CSS classes when possible"
- "Match dark/light theme automatically"
- "Don't break existing GitHub functionality"
- "Inject dropdown near profile icon"
- "Store minimal user data (username, avatar, profile URL)"

## UI/UX Guidelines

ui_rules:

- "Follow prototype image exactly"
- "Use GitHub's native styling patterns"
- "Smooth animations under 200ms"
- "Mobile responsive design"
- "Proper z-index management"
- "Accessible keyboard navigation"

## Security & Privacy

security_rules:

- "NO password storage ever"
- "Local storage only, no external APIs"
- "Minimal permissions request"
- "Respect user privacy"
- "Handle expired sessions gracefully"

## Performance Targets

performance:

- "Bundle size < 200KB"
- "Injection speed < 100ms"
- "Memory usage < 5MB"
- "Zero impact on page load"

## Development Workflow

workflow:

- "Clean LinkedIn logic first"
- "Build core structure"
- "Implement GitHub detection"
- "Add dropdown injection"
- "Test account switching"
- "Polish animations"

## Critical Implementation Notes

critical_notes:

- "The extension MUST reduce clicks from 3 to 1"
- "Dropdown must feel native to GitHub"
- "Handle multiple GitHub page layouts"
- "Account detection should be automatic"
- "Switching should preserve current page context"

## File Priorities

file_priorities:
1: "manifest.json - clean and update for GitHub"
2: "content script - GitHub DOM detection and injection"
3: "background script - account storage management"
4: "styles - match GitHub's design system"
5: "types - TypeScript interfaces for accounts"

## Testing Requirements

testing:

- "Test on multiple GitHub pages (repo, issues, PRs)"
- "Verify theme compatibility (dark/light)"
- "Check mobile responsiveness"
- "Test with 2+ GitHub accounts"
- "Validate extension doesn't break GitHub features"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

avoid:

- "Don't hardcode GitHub selectors (they change)"
- "Don't store sensitive data"
- "Don't interfere with GitHub's JavaScript"
- "Don't make external network requests"
- "Don't assume specific page structures"

## Claude Sonnet 4 Specific Instructions

claude_instructions:

- "Analyze attached screenshots before coding"
- "Reference prototype image for exact styling"
- "Build complete working extension in first iteration"
- "Focus on TypeScript accuracy and browser APIs"
- "Prioritize clean, maintainable code structure"
