# github-switchme-browser-extension

**Quick switch between your GitHub accounts with zero hassle.**

## What it does

Tired of GitHub's clunky account switching? Currently takes 3 clicks + page reload just to switch users. This extension cuts that down to 1 click with a clean dropdown right from your profile icon.

## The problem

GitHub's current UX: Profile → Switch Account → Pick User → Wait for reload
Our solution: Profile → Pick User (done)

## Features

- **One-click switching** between logged-in GitHub accounts
- **Native GitHub styling** - looks like it belongs there
- **Auto-detects accounts** when you log in from different tabs
- **Secure & private** - no passwords stored, works with GitHub's existing auth
- **Cross-browser support** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge

## Technical stack

Built with TypeScript, Manifest v3, and modern browser APIs. Injects seamlessly into GitHub's interface without breaking anything.

## Installation

*(Coming to Chrome Web Store soon)*

For now: Clone, build, load unpacked extension

## Why build this?

Because switching GitHub accounts shouldn't feel like filing taxes. Simple problems deserve simple solutions.

*This extension respects GitHub's terms of service and only works with accounts you're already logged into.*
